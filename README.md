# Productivity Suite

The **main goal** of this project is to recall the knowledge of the DDD concept I worked on last time in 2018.

This project will represent a simple to-do/task tracker, like Microsoft TODO or Apple Reminders applications.

I'll start this project with an analysis of similar applications and build a domain model based on it and then implement it.

In parallel, I'll try to describe why I choose one approach over another and looking forward to any feedback on the topics! 

## Technical stack

- PHP ^7.4
- Symfony ^5.0
- PostgreSQL ^13.1
- Containerization with Docker ^19.0

## Deliverables

As a result, we should get a RESTful Web API service.
