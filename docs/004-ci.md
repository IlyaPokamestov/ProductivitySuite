## Continuous Integration

I've implemented a CI pipeline for the project with Github Actions.

The pipeline executes each new change in any open PR to the master branch OR after changes merged to the master branch.

CI pipeline is performing the next actions:
- Installing project dependencies.
- Execute static code analysis.
- Execute unit tests.
- Execute functional tests.

### Additional automation 

Github Labeller added to set labels according to the area of changes automatically.
A big team can help reduce the efforts of managing the number of pull requests in a more effective way.

Added plugin for PHPUnit which publishing annotations on assertion check which are failing, which can help to understand quicker 
which test is failing and why without the overhead of pre-execution of the test suites locally.
 
### Docker container publishing

TBD
